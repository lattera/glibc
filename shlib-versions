# The following lines list filename patterns matching canonical configurations,

# list is processed, with earlier entries taking precedence over later
# entries.  So loose patterns at the end of the list can give defaults.

# Configuration		Library versions
# -------------		------- --------

# The interface to -lm depends only on cpu, not on operating system.
i?86-*-*		libm=6

# We provide libc.so.6 for Linux kernel versions 2.0 and later.
i?86-*-linux*		libc=6
m68k-*-linux*		libc=6
alpha-*-linux*		libc=6

# libmachuser.so.1 corresponds to mach/*.defs as of Utah's UK22 release.

# libhurduser.so.0.0 corresponds to hurd/*.defs as of 7 May 1996.
*-*-gnu*		libhurduser=0.0

# libc.so.0.2 is for the Hurd alpha release 0.2.
*-*-gnu*		libc=0.2

# The -ldl interface (see <dlfcn.h>) is the same on all platforms.
*-*-*			libdl=2

# So far the -lutil interface is the same on all platforms, except for the
# `struct utmp' format, which depends on libc.
*-*-*			libutil=1

# Version number 2 is used on other systems for the BIND 4.9.4 resolver
# interface.
*-*-*			libresolv=2

# Interface revision of nss_* modules.  This must match NSS_SHLIB_REVISION
# in nss/nsswitch.h, which determines the library names used for service
# names given in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

# We use libdb.so.2 for the interface in version 1.85 of the Berkeley DB code.
