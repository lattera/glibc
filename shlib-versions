# This file defines the shared library version numbers we will install.

# The following lines list filename patterns matching canonical configurations,
# and the associated versions to use for various libraries.  The entire
# list is processed, with earlier entries taking precedence over later
# entries.  So loose patterns at the end of the list can give defaults.

# Configuration		Library versions
# -------------		------- --------

# The interface to -lm depends only on cpu, not on operating system.

# We provide libc.so.6 for Linux kernel versions 1.3.95 and later.
i?86-*-linux*		libc=6
