# This file defines the ABI tag value we will use in the ELF note included
# in the startup code to be linked into every program.

# The following lines list regexps matching canonical configurations, and
# the associated ABI tag values.  The entire list is processed, with
# earlier entries taking precedence over later entries.  So loose patterns
# at the end of the list can give defaults.

# The ABI tag values we use are 32-bit quantities stored in machine byte order.
# Conventionally the high-order byte indicates the OS and the low three
# bytes form a version number associated with a particular ABI version.

# After the configuration regexp, four integers in C syntax appear
# surrounded by any whitespace or punctuation, one for each byte, MSB first.

# Configuration		ABI OS	ABI version
# -------------		------	-----------

.*-.*-linux.*		0	2.0.0	# earliest compatible kernel version

.*-.*-gnu-gnu.*		1	0.0.0

sparc-sun-solaris2.*	2	2.0.0	# just an arbitrary value

# There is no catch-all default here because every supported OS that uses
# ELF must have its own unique ABI tag.
