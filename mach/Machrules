# Makefiles may define these variable before including this file:

#	server-interfaces	Names of interfaces to put server stubs in for.
#	interface-library	Name of interface library to build and install.
# This file sets:
#	interface-headers	Names of generated interface header files.
#	interface-routines	Names of generated interface routines.
# All user stubs are put in individual files, prefixed with RPC_; header
# for both __ and non-__ names is put in foo.h.  Server interfaces are
# written to foo_server.c and foo_server.h; the server functions are called
# _S_rpcname.

# Includers can also add to or modify `migdefines' to set MiG flags.

# %.ir defines a variable `%-calls', which lists the RPCs defined by
# %.defs, and a rule to build $(%-calls:%=RPC_$(%-userprefix)%.c) from
# %.defs, where $(%-userprefix) is the user prefix given in %.defs.  We use
# the kludgificacious method of defining a pattern rule to build files
# matching patterns we are pretty damn sure will only match the particular
# files we have in mind.  To be so damn sure, we use the silly names
# RPC_*.c and the pattern R%C_*.c because using __*.c and _%*.c (or any
# other useful pattern) causes the rule for `host_info' to also match
# `xxx_host_info', and analogous lossage.
#
# While we're at it, we figure out the imports used by %.defs and give them
# as dependencies of the object files for the generated RPC_*.c files.
#
# Depend on %.h just so they will be built from %.uh in the
# makefile-rebuilding run which builds %.ir; otherwise, %.uh is built as an
# intermediate in order to make %.ir and then removed before re-exec, when
# %.uh is built all over again to build %.h.
