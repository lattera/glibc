Status of Hurd support in libc.  Last updated 22 Nov 1994.

Everything not noted below is implemented, most of it tested.  There are
various very small things unfinished or thought to be perhaps wrong
throughout the code, marked by comments containing `XXX'.


* Signals and job control work, but are a very hairy area.
  There are various ways the signal thread can block and fail
  to respond when the program is losing badly.

* We are not sure about possible races between setpgrp (A, pgrp) from
  process B vs process A receiving proc_newids.

* The rest of libc (stdio et al) is not safe for multithreaded programs.
  mutex locks should be added to various things.

* Recovery from faults in the signal thread is not implemented yet.

* longjmp needs to clean up reply port, intr_port; needs thought about.

* Cooperation with cthreads is not finished.  If you link with cthreads,
  libc internal code still does not use real condition variables.
  sigsuspend currently does a busy wait where it should use a condition.
  Signal state is per kernel thread; for unwired cthreads it should be per
  cthread instead.

* sigaltstack/sigstack do not really work: the signal stack needs thread
  variables and cthread data set up, which is not done.

* malloc is a kludge.

* Nothing uses mapped io.  Eventually stdio and read/write/seek should.  I
  have written a little code for this, but it is far from finished.

* Resource limits do not really work; current implementation is patchy and
  inconsistent.

* libc implicitly uses some environment variables.  This is a security
  problem for setuid exec.  Probably crt0 should remove the variables from
  the environment if setuid.

* The miscellaneous msg.defs calls are only partially implemented.

* The default SIGINFO handler needs to be written.

* File locking is not implemented; the RPC interface is not there yet.

* The current getitimer/setitimer implementation is a kludge.

* mmap cannot do MAP_NOEXTEND.

* Unimplemented calls (from the 4.4 system call list):
acct
fstatfs
getfh
getfsstat
getrusage
madvise
mincore
mount
msync
profil
recvmsg
revoke
sendmsg
setpriority
sstk
statfs
swapon
unmount
