@chapter String and Array Utilities

Operations on strings (or arrays of characters) are an important part of
many programs.  @Theglibc{} provides an extensive set of string
utility functions, including functions for copying, concatenating,
comparing, and searching strings.  Many of these functions can also
operate on arbitrary regions of storage; for example, the @code{memcpy}
function can be used to copy the contents of any kind of array.

It's fairly common for beginning C programmers to ``reinvent the wheel''
by duplicating this functionality in their own code, but it pays to
become familiar with the library functions and to make use of them,
since this offers benefits in maintenance, efficiency, and portability.

For instance, you could easily compare one string to another in two
lines of C code, but if you use the built-in @code{strcmp} function,
you're less likely to make a mistake.  And, since these library
functions are typically highly optimized, your program may run faster
too.

@node Representation of Strings
@section Representation of Strings
@cindex string, representation of

This section is a quick summary of string concepts for beginning C
programmers.  It describes how character strings are represented in C
and some common pitfalls.  If you are already familiar with this
material, you can skip this section.

@cindex string
@cindex multibyte character string
A @dfn{string} is an array of @code{char} objects.  But string-valued
variables are usually declared to be pointers of type @code{char *}.
Such variables do not include space for the text of a string; that has
to be stored somewhere else---in an array variable, a string constant,
or dynamically allocated memory (@pxref{Memory Allocation}).  It's up to
you to store the address of the chosen memory space into the pointer
variable.  Alternatively you can store a @dfn{null pointer} in the
pointer variable.  The null pointer does not point anywhere, so
attempting to reference the string it points to gets an error.

@cindex wide character string
``string'' normally refers to multibyte character strings as opposed to
wide character strings.  Wide character strings are arrays of type
@code{wchar_t} and as for multibyte character strings usually pointers
of type @code{wchar_t *} are used.

@cindex null character
@cindex null wide character
By convention, a @dfn{null character}, @code{'\0'}, marks the end of a
multibyte character string and the @dfn{null wide character},
@code{L'\0'}, marks the end of a wide character string.  For example, in
testing to see whether the @code{char *} variable @var{p} points to a
null character marking the end of a string, you can write
@code{!*@var{p}} or @code{*@var{p} == '\0'}.

A null character is quite different conceptually from a null pointer,
although both are represented by the integer @code{0}.

@cindex string literal
@dfn{String literals} appear in C program source as strings of
characters between double-quote characters (@samp{"}) where the initial
double-quote character is immediately preceded by a capital @samp{L}
(ell) character (as in @code{L"foo"}).  In @w{ISO C}, string literals
can also be formed by @dfn{string concatenation}: @code{"a" "b"} is the
same as @code{"ab"}.  For wide character strings one can either use
@code{L"a" L"b"} or @code{L"a" "b"}.  Modification of string literals is
not allowed by the GNU C compiler, because literals are placed in
read-only storage.

Character arrays that are declared @code{const} cannot be modified
either.  It's generally good style to declare non-modifiable string
pointers to be of type @code{const char *}, since this often allows the
C compiler to detect accidental modifications as well as providing some
amount of documentation about what your program intends to do with the
string.

The amount of memory allocated for the character array may extend past
the null character that normally marks the end of the string.  In this
document, the term @dfn{allocated size} is always used to refer to the
total amount of memory allocated for the string, while the term
@dfn{length} refers to the number of characters up to (but not
including) the terminating null character.
@cindex length of string
@cindex allocation size of string
@cindex size of string
@cindex string length
@cindex string allocation

A notorious source of program bugs is trying to put more characters in a
string than fit in its allocated size.  When writing code that extends
strings or moves characters into a pre-allocated array, you should be
very careful to keep track of the length of the text and make explicit
checks for overflowing the array.  Many of the library functions
@emph{do not} do this for you!  Remember also that you need to allocate
an extra byte to hold the null character that marks the end of the
string.

@cindex single-byte string
@cindex multibyte string
Originally strings were sequences of bytes where each byte represents a
single character.  This is still true today if the strings are encoded
using a single-byte character encoding.  Things are different if the
strings are encoded using a multibyte encoding (for more information on
encodings see @ref{Extended Char Intro}).  There is no difference in
the programming interface for these two kind of strings; the programmer
has to be aware of this and interpret the byte sequences accordingly.

But since there is no separate interface taking care of these
differences the byte-based string functions are sometimes hard to use.
Since the count parameters of these functions specify bytes a call to
@code{strncpy} could cut a multibyte character in the middle and put an
incomplete (and therefore unusable) byte sequence in the target buffer.

@cindex wide character string
To avoid these problems later versions of the @w{ISO C} standard
introduce a second set of functions which are operating on @dfn{wide
characters} (@pxref{Extended Char Intro}).  These functions don't have
the problems the single-byte versions have since every wide character is
a legal, interpretable value.  This does not mean that cutting wide
character strings at arbitrary points is without problems.  It normally
is for alphabet-based languages (except for non-normalized text) but
languages based on syllables still have the problem that more than one
wide character is necessary to complete a logical unit.  This is a
higher level problem which the @w{C library} functions are not designed
to solve.  But it is at least good that no invalid byte sequences can be
created.  Also, the higher level functions can also much easier operate
on wide character than on multibyte characters so that a general advise
is to use wide characters internally whenever text is more than simply
copied.

The remaining of this chapter will discuss the functions for handling
wide character strings in parallel with the discussion of the multibyte
character strings since there is almost always an exact equivalent
available.

@node String/Array Conventions
@section String and Array Conventions

This chapter describes both functions that work on arbitrary arrays or
blocks of memory, and functions that are specific to null-terminated
arrays of characters and wide characters.

Functions that operate on arbitrary blocks of memory have names
beginning with @samp{mem} and @samp{wmem} (such as @code{memcpy} and
@code{wmemcpy}) and invariably take an argument which specifies the size
(in bytes and wide characters respectively) of the block of memory to
operate on.  The array arguments and return values for these functions
have type @code{void *} or @code{wchar_t}.  As a matter of style, the
elements of the arrays used with the @samp{mem} functions are referred
to as ``bytes''.  You can pass any kind of pointer to these functions,
and the @code{sizeof} operator is useful in computing the value for the
size argument.  Parameters to the @samp{wmem} functions must be of type
@code{wchar_t *}.  These functions are not really usable with anything
but arrays of this type.

In contrast, functions that operate specifically on strings and wide
character strings have names beginning with @samp{str} and @samp{wcs}
respectively (such as @code{strcpy} and @code{wcscpy}) and look for a
null character to terminate the string instead of requiring an explicit
size argument to be passed.  (Some of these functions accept a specified
maximum length, but they also check for premature termination with a
null character.)  The array arguments and return values for these
functions have type @code{char *} and @code{wchar_t *} respectively, and
the array elements are referred to as ``characters'' and ``wide
characters''.

In many cases, there are both @samp{mem} and @samp{str}/@samp{wcs}
versions of a function.  The one that is more appropriate to use depends
on the exact situation.  When your program is manipulating arbitrary
arrays or blocks of storage, then you should always use the @samp{mem}
functions.  On the other hand, when you are manipulating null-terminated
strings it is usually more convenient to use the @samp{str}/@samp{wcs}
functions, unless you already know the length of the string in advance.
The @samp{wmem} functions should be used for wide character arrays with
known size.

@cindex wint_t
@cindex parameter promotion
Some of the memory and string functions take single characters as
arguments.  Since a value of type @code{char} is automatically promoted
into an value of type @code{int} when used as a parameter, the functions
are declared with @code{int} as the type of the parameter in question.
In case of the wide character function the situation is similarly: the
parameter type for a single wide character is @code{wint_t} and not
@code{wchar_t}.  This would for many implementations not be necessary
since the @code{wchar_t} is large enough to not be automatically
promoted, but since the @w{ISO C} standard does not require such a
choice of types the @code{wint_t} type is used.

@node String Length
@section String Length

You can get the length of a string using the @code{strlen} function.
This function is declared in the header file @file{string.h}.
@pindex string.h

@comment string.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun size_t strlen (const char *@var{s})
The @code{strlen} function returns the length of the null-terminated
string @var{s} in bytes.  (In other words, it returns the offset of the
terminating null character within the array.)

For example,
@smallexample
strlen ("hello, world")
    @result{} 12
@end smallexample

When applied to a character array, the @code{strlen} function returns
the length of the string stored there, not its allocated size.  You can
get the allocated size of the character array that holds a string using
the @code{sizeof} operator:

@smallexample
char string[32] = "hello, world";
sizeof (string)
    @result{} 32
strlen (string)
    @result{} 12
@end smallexample

But beware, this will not work unless @var{string} is the character
array itself, not a pointer to it.  For example:

@smallexample
char string[32] = "hello, world";
char *ptr = string;
sizeof (string)
    @result{} 32
sizeof (ptr)
    @result{} 4  /* @r{(on a machine with 4 byte pointers)} */
@end smallexample

This is an easy mistake to make when you are working with functions that
take string arguments; those arguments are always pointers, not arrays.

It must also be noted that for multibyte encoded strings the return
value does not have to correspond to the number of characters in the
string.  To get this value the string can be converted to wide
characters and @code{wcslen} can be used or something like the following
code can be used:

@smallexample
/* @r{The input is in @code{string}.}
   @r{The length is expected in @code{n}.}  */
@{
  mbstate_t t;
  char *scopy = string;
  /* In initial state.  */
  memset (&t, '\0', sizeof (t));
  /* Determine number of characters.  */
  n = mbsrtowcs (NULL, &scopy, strlen (scopy), &t);
@}
@end smallexample

This is cumbersome to do so if the number of characters (as opposed to
bytes) is needed often it is better to work with wide characters.
@end deftypefun

The wide character equivalent is declared in @file{wchar.h}.

@comment wchar.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun size_t wcslen (const wchar_t *@var{ws})
The @code{wcslen} function is the wide character equivalent to
@code{strlen}.  The return value is the number of wide characters in the
wide character string pointed to by @var{ws} (this is also the offset of
the terminating null wide character of @var{ws}).

Since there are no multi wide character sequences making up one
character the return value is not only the offset in the array, it is
also the number of wide characters.

This function was introduced in @w{Amendment 1} to @w{ISO C90}.
@end deftypefun

@comment string.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun size_t strnlen (const char *@var{s}, size_t @var{maxlen})
The @code{strnlen} function returns the length of the string @var{s} in
bytes if this length is smaller than @var{maxlen} bytes.  Otherwise it
returns @var{maxlen}.  Therefore this function is equivalent to
@code{(strlen (@var{s}) < @var{maxlen} ? strlen (@var{s}) : @var{maxlen})}
but it
is more efficient and works even if the string @var{s} is not
null-terminated.

@smallexample
char string[32] = "hello, world";
strnlen (string, 32)
    @result{} 12
strnlen (string, 5)
    @result{} 5
@end smallexample

This function is a GNU extension and is declared in @file{string.h}.
@end deftypefun

@comment wchar.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun size_t wcsnlen (const wchar_t *@var{ws}, size_t @var{maxlen})
@code{wcsnlen} is the wide character equivalent to @code{strnlen}.  The
@var{maxlen} parameter specifies the maximum number of wide characters.

This function is a GNU extension and is declared in @file{wchar.h}.
@end deftypefun

@node Copying and Concatenation
@section Copying and Concatenation

You can use the functions described in this section to copy the contents
of strings and arrays, or to append the contents of one string to
another.  The @samp{str} and @samp{mem} functions are declared in the
header file @file{string.h} while the @samp{wstr} and @samp{wmem}
functions are declared in the file @file{wchar.h}.
@pindex string.h
@pindex wchar.h
@cindex copying strings and arrays
@cindex string copy functions
@cindex array copy functions
@cindex concatenating strings
@cindex string concatenation functions

A helpful way to remember the ordering of the arguments to the functions
in this section is that it corresponds to an assignment expression, with
the destination array specified to the left of the source array.  All
of these functions return the address of the destination array.

Most of these functions do not work properly if the source and
destination arrays overlap.  For example, if the beginning of the
destination array overlaps the end of the source array, the original
contents of that part of the source array may get overwritten before it
is copied.  Even worse, in the case of the string functions, the null
character marking the end of the string may be lost, and the copy
function might get stuck in a loop trashing all the memory allocated to
your program.

All functions that have problems copying between overlapping arrays are
explicitly identified in this manual.  In addition to functions in this
section, there are a few others like @code{sprintf} (@pxref{Formatted
Output Functions}) and @code{scanf} (@pxref{Formatted Input
Functions}).

@comment string.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun {void *} memcpy (void *restrict @var{to}, const void *restrict @var{from}, size_t @var{size})
The @code{memcpy} function copies @var{size} bytes from the object
beginning at @var{from} into the object beginning at @var{to}.  The
behavior of this function is undefined if the two arrays @var{to} and
@var{from} overlap; use @code{memmove} instead if overlapping is possible.

The value returned by @code{memcpy} is the value of @var{to}.

Here is an example of how you might use @code{memcpy} to copy the
contents of an array:

@smallexample
struct foo *oldarray, *newarray;
int arraysize;
@dots{}
memcpy (new, old, arraysize * sizeof (struct foo));
@end smallexample
@end deftypefun

@comment wchar.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun {wchar_t *} wmemcpy (wchar_t *restrict @var{wto}, const wchar_t *restrict @var{wfrom}, size_t @var{size})
The @code{wmemcpy} function copies @var{size} wide characters from the object
beginning at @var{wfrom} into the object beginning at @var{wto}.  The
behavior of this function is undefined if the two arrays @var{wto} and
@var{wfrom} overlap; use @code{wmemmove} instead if overlapping is possible.

The following is a possible implementation of @code{wmemcpy} but there
are more optimizations possible.

@smallexample
wchar_t *
wmemcpy (wchar_t *restrict wto, const wchar_t *restrict wfrom,
         size_t size)
@{
  return (wchar_t *) memcpy (wto, wfrom, size * sizeof (wchar_t));
@}
@end smallexample

The value returned by @code{wmemcpy} is the value of @var{wto}.

This function was introduced in @w{Amendment 1} to @w{ISO C90}.
@end deftypefun

@comment string.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun {void *} mempcpy (void *restrict @var{to}, const void *restrict @var{from}, size_t @var{size})
The @code{mempcpy} function is nearly identical to the @code{memcpy}
function.  It copies @var{size} bytes from the object beginning at
@code{from} into the object pointed to by @var{to}.  But instead of
returning the value of @var{to} it returns a pointer to the byte
following the last written byte in the object beginning at @var{to}.
I.e., the value is @code{((void *) ((char *) @var{to} + @var{size}))}.

This function is useful in situations where a number of objects shall be
copied to consecutive memory positions.

@smallexample
void *
combine (void *o1, size_t s1, void *o2, size_t s2)
@{
  void *result = malloc (s1 + s2);
  if (result != NULL)
    mempcpy (mempcpy (result, o1, s1), o2, s2);
  return result;

@comment GNU
@deftypefun {wchar_t *} wmempcpy (wchar_t *restrict @var{wto}, const wchar_t *restrict @var{wfrom}, size_t @var{size})
The @code{wmempcpy} function is nearly identical to the @code{wmemcpy}
function.  It copies @var{size} wide characters from the object
beginning at @code{wfrom} into the object pointed to by @var{wto}.  But
instead of returning the value of @var{wto} it returns a pointer to the
wide character following the last written wide character in the object
beginning at @var{wto}.  I.e., the value is @code{@var{wto} + @var{size}}.

This function is useful in situations where a number of objects shall be
copied to consecutive memory positions.

The following is a possible implementation of @code{wmemcpy} but there
are more optimizations possible.

@smallexample

@deftypefun {void *} memmove (void *@var{to}, const void *@var{from}, size_t @var{size})
@code{memmove} copies the @var{size} bytes at @var{from} into the
@var{size} bytes at @var{to}, even if those two blocks of space
overlap.  In the case of overlap, @code{memmove} is careful to copy the
original values of the bytes in the block at @var{from}, including those
bytes which also belong to the block at @var{to}.

The value returned by @code{memmove} is the value of @var{to}.

@code{wmemmove} copies the @var{size} wide characters at @var{wfrom}
into the @var{size} wide characters at @var{wto}, even if those two
blocks of space overlap.  In the case of overlap, @code{memmove} is
careful to copy the original values of the wide characters in the block
at @var{wfrom}, including those wide characters which also belong to the
block at @var{wto}.

The following is a possible implementation of @code{wmemcpy} but there

@deftypefun {void *} memccpy (void *restrict @var{to}, const void *restrict @var{from}, int @var{c}, size_t @var{size})
This function copies no more than @var{size} bytes from @var{from} to
@var{to}, stopping if a byte matching @var{c} is found.  The return
value is a pointer into @var{to} one byte past where @var{c} was copied,
or a null pointer if no byte matching @var{c} appeared in the first
@var{size} bytes of @var{from}.
@end deftypefun

@comment string.h

@deftypefun {void *} memset (void *@var{block}, int @var{c}, size_t @var{size})
This function copies the value of @var{c} (converted to an

object beginning at @var{block}.  It returns the value of @var{block}.
@end deftypefun

@comment wchar.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun {wchar_t *} wmemset (wchar_t *@var{block}, wchar_t @var{wc}, size_t @var{size})

returns the value of @var{block}.

@deftypefun {char *} strcpy (char *restrict @var{to}, const char *restrict @var{from})
This copies characters from the string @var{from} (up to and including

@code{memcpy}, this function has undefined results if the strings
overlap.  The return value is the value of @var{to}.
@end deftypefun

@comment ISO
@deftypefun {wchar_t *} wcscpy (wchar_t *restrict @var{wto}, const wchar_t *restrict @var{wfrom})
This copies wide characters from the string @var{wfrom} (up to and

@var{wto}.  Like @code{wmemcpy}, this function has undefined results if
the strings overlap.  The return value is the value of @var{wto}.

@deftypefun {char *} strncpy (char *restrict @var{to}, const char *restrict @var{from}, size_t @var{size})
This function is similar to @code{strcpy} but always copies exactly
@var{size} characters into @var{to}.

If the length of @var{from} is more than @var{size}, then @code{strncpy}
copies just the first @var{size} characters.  Note that in this case
there is no null terminator written into @var{to}.

If the length of @var{from} is less than @var{size}, then @code{strncpy}
copies all of @var{from}, followed by enough null characters to add up
to @var{size} characters in all.  This behavior is rarely useful, but it
is specified by the @w{ISO C} standard.

The behavior of @code{strncpy} is undefined if the strings overlap.

Using @code{strncpy} as opposed to @code{strcpy} is a way to avoid bugs
relating to writing past the end of the allocated space for @var{to}.
However, it can also make your program much slower in one common case:
copying a string which is probably small into a potentially large buffer.
In this case, @var{size} may be large, and when it is, @code{strncpy} will
waste a considerable amount of time copying null characters.

@comment ISO
@deftypefun {wchar_t *} wcsncpy (wchar_t *restrict @var{wto}, const wchar_t *restrict @var{wfrom}, size_t @var{size})
This function is similar to @code{wcscpy} but always copies exactly
@var{size} wide characters into @var{wto}.

If the length of @var{wfrom} is more than @var{size}, then
@code{wcsncpy} copies just the first @var{size} wide characters.  Note
that in this case there is no null terminator written into @var{wto}.

If the length of @var{wfrom} is less than @var{size}, then

This function is similar to @code{strdup} but always copies at most

If the length of @var{s} is more than @var{size}, then @code{strndup}
copies just the first @var{size} characters and adds a closing null

This function is different to @code{strncpy} in that it always

@comment string.h
@comment Unknown origin
@deftypefun {char *} stpcpy (char *restrict @var{to}, const char *restrict @var{from})
This function is like @code{strcpy}, except that it returns a pointer to
the end of the string @var{to} (that is, the address of the terminating
null character @code{to + strlen (from)}) rather than the beginning.

For example, this program uses @code{stpcpy} to concatenate @samp{foo}
and @samp{bar} to produce @samp{foobar}, which it then prints.

@smallexample
@include stpcpy.c.texi
@end smallexample

This function is not part of the ISO or POSIX standards, and is not

This macro is similar to @code{strdup} but allocates the new string

For obvious reasons @code{strdupa} is implemented only as a macro;
you cannot get the address of this function.  Despite this limitation
it is a useful function.  The following code shows a situation where

@end deftypefun

Programmers using the @code{strcat} or @code{wcscat} function (or the
following @code{strncat} or @code{wcsncar} functions for that matter)
can easily be recognized as lazy and reckless.  In almost all situations
the lengths of the participating strings are known (it better should be
since how can one otherwise ensure the allocated size of the buffer is
sufficient?)  Or at least, one could know them if one keeps track of the
results of the various function calls.  But then it is very inefficient
to use @code{strcat}/@code{wcscat}.  A lot of time is wasted finding the
end of the destination string so that the actual copying can start.
This is a common example:

@cindex __va_copy
@cindex va_copy
@smallexample
/* @r{This function concatenates arbitrarily many strings.  The last}
   @r{parameter must be @code{NULL}.}  */
char *
concat (const char *str, @dots{})
@{
  va_list ap, ap2;
  size_t total = 1;
  const char *s;
  char *result;

  va_start (ap, str);
  /* @r{Actually @code{va_copy}, but this is the name more gcc versions}
     @r{understand.}  */
  __va_copy (ap2, ap);

  /* @r{Determine how much space we need.}  */
  for (s = str; s != NULL; s = va_arg (ap, const char *))
    total += strlen (s);

  va_end (ap);

  result = (char *) malloc (total);
  if (result != NULL)
    @{
      result[0] = '\0';

      /* @r{Copy the strings.}  */
      for (s = str; s != NULL; s = va_arg (ap2, const char *))
        strcat (result, s);
    @}

  va_end (ap2);

  return result;
@}
@end smallexample

This looks quite simple, especially the second loop where the strings
are actually copied.  But these innocent lines hide a major performance
penalty.  Just imagine that ten strings of 100 bytes each have to be
concatenated.  For the second string we search the already stored 100
bytes for the end of the string so that we can append the next string.
For all strings in total the comparisons necessary to find the end of
the intermediate results sums up to 5500!  If we combine the copying
with the search for the allocation we can write this function more
efficient:

@smallexample
char *
concat (const char *str, @dots{})
@{
  va_list ap;
  size_t allocated = 100;
  char *result = (char *) malloc (allocated);

  if (result != NULL)
    @{
      char *newp;
      char *wp;

      va_start (ap, str);

      wp = result;
      for (s = str; s != NULL; s = va_arg (ap, const char *))
        @{
          size_t len = strlen (s);

          /* @r{Resize the allocated memory if necessary.}  */
          if (wp + len + 1 > result + allocated)
            @{
              allocated = (allocated + len) * 2;
              newp = (char *) realloc (result, allocated);
              if (newp == NULL)
                @{
                  free (result);
                  return NULL;
                @}
              wp = newp + (wp - result);
              result = newp;
            @}

          wp = mempcpy (wp, s, len);
        @}

      /* @r{Terminate the result string.}  */
      *wp++ = '\0';

      /* @r{Resize memory to the optimal size.}  */
      newp = realloc (result, wp - result);
      if (newp != NULL)
        result = newp;

      va_end (ap);
    @}

  return result;
@}
@end smallexample

With a bit more knowledge about the input strings one could fine-tune
the memory allocation.  The difference we are pointing to here is that
we don't use @code{strcat} anymore.  We always keep track of the length
of the current intermediate result so we can safe us the search for the
end of the string and use @code{mempcpy}.  Please note that we also
don't use @code{stpcpy} which might seem more natural since we handle
with strings.  But this is not necessary since we already know the
length of the string and therefore can use the faster memory copying
function.  The example would work for wide characters the same way.

Whenever a programmer feels the need to use @code{strcat} she or he
should think twice and look through the program whether the code cannot
be rewritten to take advantage of already calculated results.  Again: it
is almost always unnecessary to use @code{strcat}.

You can use the functions in this section to perform comparisons on the
contents of strings and arrays.  As well as checking for equality, these
functions can also be used as the ordering functions for sorting
operations.  @xref{Searching and Sorting}, for an example of this.

Unlike most comparison operations in C, the string comparison functions
return a nonzero value if the strings are @emph{not} equivalent rather
than if they are.  The sign of the value indicates the relative ordering
of the first characters in the strings that are not equivalent:  a
negative value indicates that the first string is ``less'' than the
second, while a positive value indicates that the first string is
``greater''.

The most common use of these functions is to check only for equality.
This is canonically done with an expression like @w{@samp{! strcmp (s1, s2)}}.

All of these functions are declared in the header file @file{string.h}.

@deftypefun int memcmp (const void *@var{a1}, const void *@var{a2}, size_t @var{size})
The function @code{memcmp} compares the @var{size} bytes of memory
beginning at @var{a1} against the @var{size} bytes of memory beginning
at @var{a2}.  The value returned has the same sign as the difference
between the first differing pair of bytes (interpreted as @code{unsigned
char} objects, then promoted to @code{int}).

If the contents of the two blocks are equal, @code{memcmp} returns
@code{0}.
@end deftypefun

@comment wcjar.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun int wmemcmp (const wchar_t *@var{a1}, const wchar_t *@var{a2}, size_t @var{size})
The function @code{wmemcmp} compares the @var{size} wide characters
beginning at @var{a1} against the @var{size} wide characters beginning
at @var{a2}.  The value returned is smaller than or larger than zero
depending on whether the first differing wide character is @var{a1} is
smaller or larger than the corresponding character in @var{a2}.

If the contents of the two blocks are equal, @code{wmemcmp} returns
@code{0}.
@end deftypefun

On arbitrary arrays, the @code{memcmp} function is mostly useful for
testing equality.  It usually isn't meaningful to do byte-wise ordering
comparisons on arrays of things other than bytes.  For example, a
byte-wise comparison on the bytes that make up floating-point numbers
isn't likely to tell you anything about the relationship between the
values of the floating-point numbers.

@code{wmemcmp} is really only useful to compare arrays of type
@code{wchar_t} since the function looks at @code{sizeof (wchar_t)} bytes
at a time and this number of bytes is system dependent.

You should also be careful about using @code{memcmp} to compare objects
that can contain ``holes'', such as the padding inserted into structure
objects to enforce alignment requirements, extra space at the end of
unions, and extra characters at the ends of strings whose length is less
than their allocated size.  The contents of these ``holes'' are
indeterminate and may cause strange behavior when performing byte-wise
comparisons.  For more predictable results, perform an explicit
component-wise comparison.

For example, given a structure type definition like:

@smallexample
struct foo
  @{
    unsigned char tag;
    union
      @{
        double f;
        long i;
        char *p;
      @} value;
  @};
@end smallexample

@noindent
you are better off writing a specialized comparison function to compare
@code{struct foo} objects instead of comparing them with @code{memcmp}.

Here are some examples showing the use of @code{strcmp} and
@code{strncmp} (equivalent examples can be constructed for the wide
character functions).  These examples assume the use of the ASCII

instead, then the glyphs are associated with different numeric codes,
and the return values and ordering may differ.)

@deftypefun int strverscmp (const char *@var{s1}, const char *@var{s2})
The @code{strverscmp} function compares the string @var{s1} against
@var{s2}, considering them as holding indices/version numbers.  The
return value follows the same conventions as found in the
@code{strcmp} function.  In fact, if @var{s1} and @var{s2} contain no
digits, @code{strverscmp} behaves like @code{strcmp}.

Basically, we compare strings normally (character by character), until
we find a digit in each string - then we enter a special comparison
mode, where each sequence of digits is taken as a whole.  If we reach the
end of these two parts without noticing a difference, we return to the
standard comparison mode.  There are two types of numeric parts:
"integral" and "fractional" (those  begin with a '0'). The types
of the numeric parts affect the way we sort them:

@itemize @bullet
@item
integral/integral: we compare values as you would expect.

@item
fractional/integral: the fractional part is less than the integral one.
Again, no surprise.

@item
fractional/fractional: the things become a bit more complex.
If the common prefix contains only leading zeroes, the longest part is less
than the other one; else the comparison behaves normally.
@end itemize

@smallexample
strverscmp ("no digit", "no digit")
    @result{} 0    /* @r{same behavior as strcmp.} */
strverscmp ("item#99", "item#100")
    @result{} <0   /* @r{same prefix, but 99 < 100.} */
strverscmp ("alpha1", "alpha001")
    @result{} >0   /* @r{fractional part inferior to integral one.} */

strverscmp ("foo.009", "foo.0")

@node Collation Functions
@section Collation Functions

@cindex collating strings
@cindex string collation functions

In some locales, the conventions for lexicographic ordering differ from
the strict numeric ordering of character codes.  For example, in Spanish
most glyphs with diacritical marks such as accents are not considered
distinct letters for the purposes of collation.  On the other hand, the
two-character sequence @samp{ll} is treated as a single letter that is
collated immediately after @samp{l}.

You can use the functions @code{strcoll} and @code{strxfrm} (declared in
the headers file @file{string.h}) and @code{wcscoll} and @code{wcsxfrm}
(declared in the headers file @file{wchar}) to compare strings using a
collation ordering appropriate for the current locale.  The locale used
by these functions in particular can be specified by setting the locale
for the @code{LC_COLLATE} category; see @ref{Locales}.
@pindex string.h
@pindex wchar.h

In the standard C locale, the collation sequence for @code{strcoll} is
the same as that for @code{strcmp}.  Similarly, @code{wcscoll} and
@code{wcscmp} are the same in this situation.

Effectively, the way these functions work is by applying a mapping to
transform the characters in a string to a byte sequence that represents
the string's position in the collating sequence of the current locale.
Comparing two such byte sequences in a simple fashion is equivalent to
comparing the strings with the locale's collating sequence.

The functions @code{strcoll} and @code{wcscoll} perform this translation
implicitly, in order to do one comparison.  By contrast, @code{strxfrm}
and @code{wcsxfrm} perform the mapping explicitly.  If you are making
multiple comparisons using the same string or set of strings, it is
likely to be more efficient to use @code{strxfrm} or @code{wcsxfrm} to
transform all the strings just once, and subsequently compare the
transformed strings with @code{strcmp} or @code{wcscmp}.

@deftypefun int strcoll (const char *@var{s1}, const char *@var{s2})
The @code{strcoll} function is similar to @code{strcmp} but uses the
collating sequence of the current locale for collation (the
@code{LC_COLLATE} locale).

@deftypefun int wcscoll (const wchar_t *@var{ws1}, const wchar_t *@var{ws2})
The @code{wcscoll} function is similar to @code{wcscmp} but uses the

@code{LC_COLLATE} locale).
@end deftypefun

Here is an example of sorting an array of strings, using @code{strcoll}
to compare them.  The actual sort algorithm is not written here; it
comes from @code{qsort} (@pxref{Array Sort Function}).  The job of the
code shown here is to say how to compare the strings while sorting them.
(Later on in this section, we will show a way to do this more
efficiently using @code{strxfrm}.)

@cindex converting string to collation order
@comment string.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun size_t strxfrm (char *restrict @var{to}, const char *restrict @var{from}, size_t @var{size})
The function @code{strxfrm} transforms the string @var{from} using the
collation transformation determined by the locale currently selected for
collation, and stores the transformed string in the array @var{to}.  Up
to @var{size} characters (including a terminating null character) are
stored.

The behavior is undefined if the strings @var{to} and @var{from}
overlap; see @ref{Copying and Concatenation}.

The return value is the length of the entire transformed string.  This
value is not affected by the value of @var{size}, but if it is greater
or equal than @var{size}, it means that the transformed string did not
entirely fit in the array @var{to}.  In this case, only as much of the
string as actually fits was stored.  To get the whole transformed
string, call @code{strxfrm} again with a bigger output array.

The transformed string may be longer than the original string, and it
may also be shorter.

If @var{size} is zero, no characters are stored in @var{to}.  In this
case, @code{strxfrm} simply returns the number of characters that would
be the length of the transformed string.  This is useful for determining
what size the allocated array should be.  It does not matter what
@var{to} is if @var{size} is zero; @var{to} may even be a null pointer.

@comment ISO
@deftypefun size_t wcsxfrm (wchar_t *restrict @var{wto}, const wchar_t *@var{wfrom}, size_t @var{size})
The function @code{wcsxfrm} transforms wide character string @var{wfrom}
using the collation transformation determined by the locale currently
selected for collation, and stores the transformed string in the array
@var{wto}.  Up to @var{size} wide characters (including a terminating null
character) are stored.

The behavior is undefined if the strings @var{wto} and @var{wfrom}
overlap; see @ref{Copying and Concatenation}.

The return value is the length of the entire transformed wide character
string.  This value is not affected by the value of @var{size}, but if
it is greater or equal than @var{size}, it means that the transformed
wide character string did not entirely fit in the array @var{wto}.  In
this case, only as much of the wide character string as actually fits
was stored.  To get the whole transformed wide character string, call
@code{wcsxfrm} again with a bigger output array.

The transformed wide character string may be longer than the original
wide character string, and it may also be shorter.

If @var{size} is zero, no characters are stored in @var{to}.  In this
case, @code{wcsxfrm} simply returns the number of wide characters that
would be the length of the transformed wide character string.  This is
useful for determining what size the allocated array should be (remember
to multiply with @code{sizeof (wchar_t)}).  It does not matter what
@var{wto} is if @var{size} is zero; @var{wto} may even be a null pointer.
@end deftypefun

Here is an example of how you can use @code{strxfrm} when
you plan to do many comparisons.  It does the same thing as the previous
example, but much faster, because it has to transform each string only
once, no matter how many times it is compared with other strings.  Even
the time needed to allocate and free storage is much less than the time
we save, when there are many strings.

Note the additional multiplication with @code{sizeof (wchar_t)} in the

@deftypefun {void *} memchr (const void *@var{block}, int @var{c}, size_t @var{size})
This function finds the first occurrence of the byte @var{c} (converted
to an @code{unsigned char}) in the initial @var{size} bytes of the
object beginning at @var{block}.  The return value is a pointer to the
located byte, or a null pointer if no match was found.

@deftypefun {wchar_t *} wmemchr (const wchar_t *@var{block}, wchar_t @var{wc}, size_t @var{size})
This function finds the first occurrence of the wide character @var{wc}
in the initial @var{size} wide characters of the object beginning at
@var{block}.  The return value is a pointer to the located wide
character, or a null pointer if no match was found.
@end deftypefun

@comment string.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun {void *} rawmemchr (const void *@var{block}, int @var{c})
Often the @code{memchr} function is used with the knowledge that the
byte @var{c} is available in the memory block specified by the
parameters.  But this means that the @var{size} parameter is not really
needed and that the tests performed with it at runtime (to check whether
the end of the block is reached) are not needed.

The @code{rawmemchr} function exists for just this situation which is
surprisingly frequent.  The interface is similar to @code{memchr} except
that the @var{size} parameter is missing.  The function will look beyond
the end of the block pointed to by @var{block} in case the programmer
made an error in assuming that the byte @var{c} is present in the block.
In this case the result is unspecified.  Otherwise the return value is a
pointer to the located byte.

This function is of special interest when looking for the end of a
string.  Since all strings are terminated by a null byte a call like

@smallexample
   rawmemchr (str, '\0')
@end smallexample

@noindent
will never go beyond the end of the string.

This function is a GNU extension.
@end deftypefun

@comment string.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun {void *} memrchr (const void *@var{block}, int @var{c}, size_t @var{size})
The function @code{memrchr} is like @code{memchr}, except that it searches
backwards from the end of the block defined by @var{block} and @var{size}
(instead of forwards from the front).

This function is a GNU extension.
@end deftypefun

@comment string.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun {char *} strchr (const char *@var{string}, int @var{c})
The @code{strchr} function finds the first occurrence of the character
@var{c} (converted to a @code{char}) in the null-terminated string
beginning at @var{string}.  The return value is a pointer to the located
character, or a null pointer if no match was found.

For example,
@smallexample
strchr ("hello, world", 'l')
    @result{} "llo, world"
strchr ("hello, world", '?')
    @result{} NULL
@end smallexample

The terminating null character is considered to be part of the string,
so you can use this function get a pointer to the end of a string by
specifying a null character as the value of the @var{c} argument.

When @code{strchr} returns a null pointer, it does not let you know
the position of the terminating null character it has found.  If you
need that information, it is better (but less portable) to use
@code{strchrnul} than to search for it a second time.
@end deftypefun

@comment wchar.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun {wchar_t *} wcschr (const wchar_t *@var{wstring}, int @var{wc})
The @code{wcschr} function finds the first occurrence of the wide
character @var{wc} in the null-terminated wide character string
beginning at @var{wstring}.  The return value is a pointer to the
located wide character, or a null pointer if no match was found.

The terminating null character is considered to be part of the wide
character string, so you can use this function get a pointer to the end
of a wide character string by specifying a null wude character as the
value of the @var{wc} argument.  It would be better (but less portable)
to use @code{wcschrnul} in this case, though.
@end deftypefun

@comment string.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun {char *} strchrnul (const char *@var{string}, int @var{c})
@code{strchrnul} is the same as @code{strchr} except that if it does
not find the character, it returns a pointer to string's terminating
null character rather than a null pointer.

This function is a GNU extension.
@end deftypefun

@comment wchar.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun {wchar_t *} wcschrnul (const wchar_t *@var{wstring}, wchar_t @var{wc})
@code{wcschrnul} is the same as @code{wcschr} except that if it does not
find the wide character, it returns a pointer to wide character string's
terminating null wide character rather than a null pointer.

This function is a GNU extension.
@end deftypefun

One useful, but unusual, use of the @code{strchr}
function is when one wants to have a pointer pointing to the NUL byte
terminating a string.  This is often written in this way:

@smallexample
  s += strlen (s);
@end smallexample

@noindent
This is almost optimal but the addition operation duplicated a bit of
the work already done in the @code{strlen} function.  A better solution
is this:

@smallexample
  s = strchr (s, '\0');
@end smallexample

There is no restriction on the second parameter of @code{strchr} so it
could very well also be the NUL character.  Those readers thinking very
hard about this might now point out that the @code{strchr} function is
more expensive than the @code{strlen} function since we have two abort
criteria.  This is right.  But in @theglibc{} the implementation of
@code{strchr} is optimized in a special way so that @code{strchr}
actually is faster.

@comment string.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun {char *} strrchr (const char *@var{string}, int @var{c})
The function @code{strrchr} is like @code{strchr}, except that it searches

from the front).

@deftypefun {char *} strstr (const char *@var{haystack}, const char *@var{needle})
This is like @code{strchr}, except that it searches @var{haystack} for a
substring @var{needle} rather than just a single character.  It
returns a pointer into the string @var{haystack} that is the first
character of the substring, or a null pointer if no match was found.  If
@var{needle} is an empty string, the function returns @var{haystack}.

For example,
@smallexample
strstr ("hello, world", "l")
    @result{} "llo, world"
strstr ("hello, world", "wo")
    @result{} "world"
@end smallexample

returns a pointer into the string @var{haystack} that is the first wide
character of the substring, or a null pointer if no match was found.  If
@var{needle} is an empty string, the function returns @var{haystack}.

@comment string.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun {char *} strcasestr (const char *@var{haystack}, const char *@var{needle})
This is like @code{strstr}, except that it ignores case in searching for
the substring.   Like @code{strcasecmp}, it is locale dependent how
uppercase and lowercase characters are related.


For example,
@smallexample
strcasestr ("hello, world", "L")
    @result{} "llo, world"

@deftypefun {void *} memmem (const void *@var{haystack}, size_t @var{haystack-len},@*const void *@var{needle}, size_t @var{needle-len})
This is like @code{strstr}, but @var{needle} and @var{haystack} are byte
arrays rather than null-terminated strings.  @var{needle-len} is the

of the characters in @var{skipset} is not important.

For example,

that are @emph{not} members of the set specified by the string @var{stopset}.
(In other words, it returns the offset of the first character in @var{string}

@node Finding Tokens in a String
@section Finding Tokens in a String

@cindex tokenizing strings
@cindex breaking a string into tokens
@cindex parsing tokens from a string
It's fairly common for programs to have a need to do some simple kinds
of lexical analysis and parsing, such as splitting a command string up
into tokens.  You can do this with the @code{strtok} function, declared
in the header file @file{string.h}.
@pindex string.h

@comment string.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun {char *} strtok (char *restrict @var{newstring}, const char *restrict @var{delimiters})
A string can be split into tokens by making a series of calls to the
function @code{strtok}.

The string to be split up is passed as the @var{newstring} argument on
the first call only.  The @code{strtok} function uses this to set up
some internal state information.  Subsequent calls to get additional
tokens from the same string are indicated by passing a null pointer as
the @var{newstring} argument.  Calling @code{strtok} with another
non-null @var{newstring} argument reinitializes the state information.
It is guaranteed that no other library function ever calls @code{strtok}
behind your back (which would mess up this internal state information).

The @var{delimiters} argument is a string that specifies a set of delimiters
that may surround the token being extracted.  All the initial characters
that are members of this set are discarded.  The first character that is
@emph{not} a member of this set of delimiters marks the beginning of the
next token.  The end of the token is found by looking for the next
character that is a member of the delimiter set.  This character in the
original string @var{newstring} is overwritten by a null character, and the
pointer to the beginning of the token in @var{newstring} is returned.

On the next call to @code{strtok}, the searching begins at the next
character beyond the one that marked the end of the previous token.
Note that the set of delimiters @var{delimiters} do not have to be the
same on every call in a series of calls to @code{strtok}.

If the end of the string @var{newstring} is reached, or if the remainder of
string consists only of delimiter characters, @code{strtok} returns
a null pointer.

Note that ``character'' is here used in the sense of byte.  In a string
using a multibyte character encoding (abstract) character consisting of
more than one byte are not treated as an entity.  Each byte is treated
separately.  The function is not locale-dependent.

A string can be split into tokens by making a series of calls to the

The string to be split up is passed as the @var{newstring} argument on
the first call only.  The @code{wcstok} function uses this to set up
some internal state information.  Subsequent calls to get additional

The @var{delimiters} argument is a wide character string that specifies
a set of delimiters that may surround the token being extracted.  All
the initial wide characters that are members of this set are discarded.
The first wide character that is @emph{not} a member of this set of
delimiters marks the beginning of the next token.  The end of the token
is found by looking for the next wide character that is a member of the
delimiter set.  This wide character in the original wide character
string @var{newstring} is overwritten by a null wide character, and the
pointer to the beginning of the token in @var{newstring} is returned.

On the next call to @code{wcstok}, the searching begins at the next
wide character beyond the one that marked the end of the previous token.
Note that the set of delimiters @var{delimiters} do not have to be the
same on every call in a series of calls to @code{wcstok}.

If the end of the wide character string @var{newstring} is reached, or
if the remainder of string consists only of delimiter wide characters,
@code{wcstok} returns a null pointer.

Note that ``character'' is here used in the sense of byte.  In a string
using a multibyte character encoding (abstract) character consisting of
more than one byte are not treated as an entity.  Each byte is treated
separately.  The function is not locale-dependent.
@end deftypefun

@strong{Warning:} Since @code{strtok} and @code{wcstok} alter the string
they is parsing, you should always copy the string to a temporary buffer
before parsing it with @code{strtok}/@code{wcstok} (@pxref{Copying and
Concatenation}).  If you allow @code{strtok} or @code{wcstok} to modify
a string that came from another part of your program, you are asking for
trouble; that string might be used for other purposes after
@code{strtok} or @code{wcstok} has modified it, and it would not have
the expected value.

The string that you are operating on might even be a constant.  Then
when @code{strtok} or @code{wcstok} tries to modify it, your program
will get a fatal signal for writing in read-only memory.  @xref{Program
Error Signals}.  Even if the operation of @code{strtok} or @code{wcstok}
would not require a modification of the string (e.g., if there is
exactly one token) the string can (and in the @glibcadj{} case will) be
modified.

This is a special case of a general principle: if a part of a program
does not have as its purpose the modification of a certain data
structure, then it is error-prone to modify the data structure
temporarily.

The functions @code{strtok} and @code{wcstok} are not reentrant.
@xref{Nonreentrancy}, for a discussion of where and why reentrancy is
important.

Here is a simple example showing the use of @code{strtok}.

@comment Yes, this example has been tested.
@smallexample
#include <string.h>
#include <stddef.h>

@dots{}

const char string[] = "words separated by spaces -- and, punctuation!";
const char delimiters[] = " .,;:!-";
char *token, *cp;

@end smallexample

@Theglibc{} contains two more functions for tokenizing a string
which overcome the limitation of non-reentrancy.  They are only
available for multibyte character strings.

@comment string.h
@comment POSIX
@deftypefun {char *} strtok_r (char *@var{newstring}, const char *@var{delimiters}, char **@var{save_ptr})
Just like @code{strtok}, this function splits the string into several
tokens which can be accessed by successive calls to @code{strtok_r}.
The difference is that the information about the next token is stored in
the space pointed to by the third argument, @var{save_ptr}, which is a
pointer to a string pointer.  Calling @code{strtok_r} with a null
pointer for @var{newstring} and leaving @var{save_ptr} between the calls
unchanged does the job without hindering reentrancy.

This function is defined in POSIX.1 and can be found on many systems
which support multi-threading.
@end deftypefun

@comment string.h
@comment BSD
@deftypefun {char *} strsep (char **@var{string_ptr}, const char *@var{delimiter})
This function has a similar functionality as @code{strtok_r} with the
@var{newstring} argument replaced by the @var{save_ptr} argument.  The
initialization of the moving pointer has to be done by the user.
Successive calls to @code{strsep} move the pointer along the tokens
separated by @var{delimiter}, returning the address of the next token
and updating @var{string_ptr} to point to the beginning of the next
token.

One difference between @code{strsep} and @code{strtok_r} is that if the
input string contains more than one character from @var{delimiter} in a
row @code{strsep} returns an empty string for each pair of characters
from @var{delimiter}.  This means that a program normally should test
for @code{strsep} returning an empty string before processing it.

This function was introduced in 4.3BSD and therefore is widely available.
@end deftypefun

Here is how the above example looks like when @code{strsep} is used.

@deftypefun {char *} basename (const char *@var{filename})
The GNU version of the @code{basename} function returns the last
component of the path in @var{filename}.  This function is the preferred
usage, since it does not modify the argument, @var{filename}, and
respects trailing slashes.  The prototype for @code{basename} can be
found in @file{string.h}.  Note, this function is overriden by the XPG
version, if @file{libgen.h} is included.

Example of using GNU @code{basename}:

@smallexample
#include <string.h>

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
@{
  char *prog = basename (argv[0]);

  if (argc < 2)
    @{
      fprintf (stderr, "Usage %s <arg>\n", prog);
      exit (1);

@strong{Portability Note:} This function may produce different results
on different systems.

@end deftypefun

@comment libgen.h
@comment XPG
@deftypefun {char *} basename (char *@var{path})
This is the standard XPG defined @code{basename}. It is similar in
spirit to the GNU version, but may modify the @var{path} by removing
trailing '/' characters.  If the @var{path} is made up entirely of '/'
characters, then "/" will be returned.  Also, if @var{path} is
@code{NULL} or an empty string, then "." is returned.  The prototype for
the XPG version can be found in @file{libgen.h}.

Example of using XPG @code{basename}:

@smallexample
#include <libgen.h>

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
@{
  char *prog;
  char *path = strdupa (argv[0]);

  prog = basename (path);

    @}

  @dots{}

@end smallexample
@end deftypefun

@comment libgen.h
@comment XPG
@deftypefun {char *} dirname (char *@var{path})
The @code{dirname} function is the compliment to the XPG version of
@code{basename}.  It returns the parent directory of the file specified
by @var{path}.  If @var{path} is @code{NULL}, an empty string, or
contains no '/' characters, then "." is returned.  The prototype for this
function can be found in @file{libgen.h}.

@node strfry
@section strfry

The function below addresses the perennial programming quandary: ``How do
I take good data in string form and painlessly turn it into garbage?''
This is actually a fairly simple task for C programmers who do not use
@theglibc{} string functions, but for programs based on @theglibc{},
the @code{strfry} function is the preferred method for
destroying string data.

The prototype for this function is in @file{string.h}.

@comment string.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun {char *} strfry (char *@var{string})

@code{strfry} creates a pseudorandom anagram of a string, replacing the
input with the anagram in place.  For each position in the string,
@code{strfry} swaps it with a position in the string selected at random
(from a uniform distribution).  The two positions may be the same.

The return value of @code{strfry} is always @var{string}.

@strong{Portability Note:}  This function is unique to @theglibc{}.

@node Trivial Encryption
@section Trivial Encryption
@cindex encryption


The @code{memfrob} function converts an array of data to something
unrecognizable and back again.  It is not encryption in its usual sense
since it is easy for someone to convert the encrypted data back to clear
text.  The transformation is analogous to Usenet's ``Rot13'' encryption
method for obscuring offensive jokes from sensitive eyes and such.
Unlike Rot13, @code{memfrob} works on arbitrary binary data, not just
text.
@cindex Rot13

For true encryption, @xref{Cryptographic Functions}.

This function is declared in @file{string.h}.
@pindex string.h

@comment string.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun {void *} memfrob (void *@var{mem}, size_t @var{length})

@code{memfrob} transforms (frobnicates) each byte of the data structure
at @var{mem}, which is @var{length} bytes long, by bitwise exclusive
oring it with binary 00101010.  It does the transformation in place and
its return value is always @var{mem}.

Note that @code{memfrob} a second time on the same data structure
returns it to its original state.

This is a good function for hiding information from someone who doesn't
want to see it or doesn't want to see it very much.  To really prevent
people from retrieving the information, use stronger encryption such as
that described in @xref{Cryptographic Functions}.

@strong{Portability Note:}  This function is unique to @theglibc{}.

@end deftypefun

@node Encode Binary Data
@section Encode Binary Data

To store or transfer binary data in environments which only support text
one has to encode the binary data by mapping the input bytes to
characters in the range allowed for storing or transfering.  SVID
systems (and nowadays XPG compliant systems) provide minimal support for
this task.

@comment stdlib.h
@comment XPG
@deftypefun {char *} l64a (long int @var{n})
This function encodes a 32-bit input value using characters from the
basic character set.  It returns a pointer to a 7 character buffer which
contains an encoded version of @var{n}.  To encode a series of bytes the
user must copy the returned string to a destination buffer.  It returns
the empty string if @var{n} is zero, which is somewhat bizarre but
mandated by the standard.@*
@strong{Warning:} Since a static buffer is used this function should not
be used in multi-threaded programs.  There is no thread-safe alternative
to this function in the C library.@*
@strong{Compatibility Note:} The XPG standard states that the return
value of @code{l64a} is undefined if @var{n} is negative.  In the GNU
implementation, @code{l64a} treats its argument as unsigned, so it will
return a sensible encoding for any nonzero @var{n}; however, portable
programs should not rely on this.

To encode a large buffer @code{l64a} must be called in a loop, once for
each 32-bit word of the buffer.  For example, one could do something
like this:

@smallexample
char *
encode (const void *buf, size_t len)
@{
  /* @r{We know in advance how long the buffer has to be.} */
  unsigned char *in = (unsigned char *) buf;
  char *out = malloc (6 + ((len + 3) / 4) * 6 + 1);
  char *cp = out, *p;

  /* @r{Encode the length.} */
  /* @r{Using `htonl' is necessary so that the data can be}
     @r{decoded even on machines with different byte order.}
     @r{`l64a' can return a string shorter than 6 bytes, so }
     @r{we pad it with encoding of 0 (}'.'@r{) at the end by }
     @r{hand.} */

  p = stpcpy (cp, l64a (htonl (len)));
  cp = mempcpy (p, "......", 6 - (p - cp));

  while (len > 3)
    @{
      unsigned long int n = *in++;
      n = (n << 8) | *in++;
      n = (n << 8) | *in++;
      n = (n << 8) | *in++;
      len -= 4;
      p = stpcpy (cp, l64a (htonl (n)));
      cp = mempcpy (p, "......", 6 - (p - cp));
    @}
  if (len > 0)
    @{
      unsigned long int n = *in++;
      if (--len > 0)
        @{
          n = (n << 8) | *in++;
          if (--len > 0)
            n = (n << 8) | *in;
        @}
      cp = stpcpy (cp, l64a (htonl (n)));
    @}
  *cp = '\0';
  return out;
@}
@end smallexample

It is strange that the library does not provide the complete
functionality needed but so be it.

@end deftypefun

To decode data produced with @code{l64a} the following function should be
used.

@comment stdlib.h
@comment XPG
@deftypefun {long int} a64l (const char *@var{string})
The parameter @var{string} should contain a string which was produced by
a call to @code{l64a}.  The function processes at least 6 characters of
this string, and decodes the characters it finds according to the table
below.  It stops decoding when it finds a character not in the table,
rather like @code{atoi}; if you have a buffer which has been broken into
lines, you must be careful to skip over the end-of-line characters.

The decoded number is returned as a @code{long int} value.
@end deftypefun

The @code{l64a} and @code{a64l} functions use a base 64 encoding, in
which each character of an encoded string represents six bits of an
input word.  These symbols are used for the base 64 digits:

@multitable {xxxxx} {xxx} {xxx} {xxx} {xxx} {xxx} {xxx} {xxx} {xxx}

@end multitable

This encoding scheme is not standard.  There are some other encoding
methods which are much more widely used (UU encoding, MIME encoding).
Generally, it is better to use one of these encodings.

@end menu

@node Argz Functions, Envz Functions, , Argz and Envz Vectors
@subsection Argz Functions

Each argz vector is represented by a pointer to the first element, of
type @code{char *}, and a size, of type @code{size_t}, both of which can
be initialized to @code{0} to represent an empty argz vector.  All argz
functions accept either a pointer and a size argument, or pointers to
them, if they will be modified.

The argz functions use @code{malloc}/@code{realloc} to allocate/grow
argz vectors, and so any argz vector creating using these functions may
be freed by using @code{free}; conversely, any argz function that may
grow a string expects that string to have been allocated using
@code{malloc} (those argz functions that only examine their arguments or
modify them in place will work on any sort of memory).
@xref{Unconstrained Allocation}.

All argz functions that do memory allocation have a return type of
@code{error_t}, and return @code{0} for success, and @code{ENOMEM} if an
allocation error occurs.

by putting pointers to every element in @var{argz} into successive

@deftypefun {char *} argz_next (char *@var{argz}, size_t @var{argz_len}, const char *@var{entry})
The @code{argz_next} function provides a convenient way of iterating
over the elements in the argz vector @var{argz}.  It returns a pointer
to the next element in @var{argz} after the element @var{entry}, or
@code{0} if there are no elements following @var{entry}.  If @var{entry}
is @code{0}, the first element of @var{argz} is returned.

This behavior suggests two styles of iteration:

@smallexample
    char *entry = 0;
    while ((entry = argz_next (@var{argz}, @var{argz_len}, entry)))
      @var{action};
@end smallexample

(the double parentheses are necessary to make some C compilers shut up
about what they consider a questionable @code{while}-test) and:

@smallexample
    char *entry;
    for (entry = @var{argz};
         entry;
         entry = argz_next (@var{argz}, @var{argz_len}, entry))
      @var{action};
@end smallexample

Note that the latter depends on @var{argz} having a value of @code{0} if
it is empty (rather than a pointer to an empty block of memory); this
invariant is maintained for argz vectors created by the functions here.

@deftypefun error_t argz_replace (@w{char **@var{argz}, size_t *@var{argz_len}}, @w{const char *@var{str}, const char *@var{with}}, @w{unsigned *@var{replace_count}})
Replace any occurrences of the string @var{str} in @var{argz} with
@var{with}, reallocating @var{argz} as necessary.  If
@var{replace_count} is non-zero, @code{*@var{replace_count}} will be
incremented by number of replacements performed.

@subsection Envz Functions

Envz vectors are just argz vectors with additional constraints on the form
of each element; as such, argz functions can also be used on them, where it
makes sense.

Each element in an envz vector is a name-value pair, separated by a @code{'='}
character; if multiple @code{'='} characters are present in an element, those
after the first are considered part of the value, and treated like all other
non-@code{'\0'} characters.

If @emph{no} @code{'='} characters are present in an element, that element is
considered the name of a ``null'' entry, as distinct from an entry with an
empty value: @code{envz_get} will return @code{0} if given the name of null
entry, whereas an entry with an empty value would result in a value of
@code{""}; @code{envz_entry} will still find such entries, however.  Null
entries can be removed with @code{envz_strip} function.

As with argz functions, envz functions that may allocate memory (and thus
fail) have a return type of @code{error_t}, and return either @code{0} or
@code{ENOMEM}.

@pindex envz.h
These functions are declared in the standard include file @file{envz.h}.

@deftypefun {char *} envz_entry (const char *@var{envz}, size_t @var{envz_len}, const char *@var{name})
The @code{envz_entry} function finds the entry in @var{envz} with the name
@var{name}, and returns a pointer to the whole entry---that is, the argz
element which begins with @var{name} followed by a @code{'='} character.  If
there is no entry with that name, @code{0} is returned.

@deftypefun {char *} envz_get (const char *@var{envz}, size_t @var{envz_len}, const char *@var{name})
The @code{envz_get} function finds the entry in @var{envz} with the name
@var{name} (like @code{envz_entry}), and returns a pointer to the value
portion of that entry (following the @code{'='}).  If there is no entry with
that name (or only a null entry), @code{0} is returned.

@deftypefun {error_t} envz_add (char **@var{envz}, size_t *@var{envz_len}, const char *@var{name}, const char *@var{value})
The @code{envz_add} function adds an entry to @code{*@var{envz}}
(updating @code{*@var{envz}} and @code{*@var{envz_len}}) with the name
@var{name}, and value @var{value}.  If an entry with the same name
already exists in @var{envz}, it is removed first.  If @var{value} is
@code{0}, then the new entry will the special null type of entry
(mentioned above).

@deftypefun {error_t} envz_merge (char **@var{envz}, size_t *@var{envz_len}, const char *@var{envz2}, size_t @var{envz2_len}, int @var{override})
The @code{envz_merge} function adds each entry in @var{envz2} to @var{envz},
as if with @code{envz_add}, updating @code{*@var{envz}} and
@code{*@var{envz_len}}.  If @var{override} is true, then values in @var{envz2}
will supersede those with the same name in @var{envz}, otherwise not.

Null entries are treated just like other entries in this respect, so a null
entry in @var{envz} can prevent an entry of the same name in @var{envz2} from
being added to @var{envz}, if @var{override} is false.

@deftypefun {void} envz_strip (char **@var{envz}, size_t *@var{envz_len})
The @code{envz_strip} function removes any null entries from @var{envz},
updating @code{*@var{envz}} and @code{*@var{envz_len}}.
