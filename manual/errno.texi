Many functions in the GNU C library detect and report error conditions,
and sometimes your programs need to check for these error conditions.
For example, when you open an input file, you should verify that the
file was actually opened correctly, and print an error message or take
other appropriate action if the call to the library function failed.

This chapter describes how the error reporting facility works.  Your
program should include the header file @file{errno.h} to use this
facility.

@section Checking for Errors

Most library functions return a special value to indicate that they have
failed.  The special value is typically @code{-1}, a null pointer, or a
constant such as @code{EOF} that is defined for that purpose.  But this
return value tells you only that an error has occurred.  To find out
what kind of error it was, you need to look at the error code stored in the
variable @code{errno}.  This variable is declared in the header file
@file{errno.h}.
@pindex errno.h

@comment errno.h
@comment ISO
@deftypevr {Variable} {volatile int} errno
The variable @code{errno} contains the system error number.  You can
change the value of @code{errno}.

Since @code{errno} is declared @code{volatile}, it might be changed
asynchronously by a signal handler; see @ref{Defining Handlers}.
However, a properly written signal handler saves and restores the value
of @code{errno}, so you generally do not need to worry about this
possibility except when writing signal handlers.

The initial value of @code{errno} at program startup is zero.  Many
library functions are guaranteed to set it to certain nonzero values
when they encounter certain kinds of errors.  These error conditions are
listed for each function.  These functions do not change @code{errno}
when they succeed; thus, the value of @code{errno} after a successful
call is not necessarily zero, and you should not use @code{errno} to
determine @emph{whether} a call failed.  The proper way to do that is
documented for each function.  @emph{If} the call the failed, you can
examine @code{errno}.

Many library functions can set @code{errno} to a nonzero value as a
result of calling other library functions which might fail.  You should
assume that any library function might alter @code{errno} when the
function returns an error.

@strong{Portability Note:} @w{ISO C} specifies @code{errno} as a
``modifiable lvalue'' rather than as a variable, permitting it to be
implemented as a macro.  For example, its expansion might involve a
function call, like @w{@code{*_errno ()}}.  In fact, that is what it is
on the GNU system itself.  The GNU library, on non-GNU systems, does
whatever is right for the particular system.

There are a few library functions, like @code{sqrt} and @code{atan},
that return a perfectly legitimate value in case of an error, but also
set @code{errno}.  For these functions, if you want to check to see
whether an error occurred, the recommended method is to set @code{errno}
to zero before calling the function, and then check its value afterward.
@end deftypevr

@pindex errno.h
All the error codes have symbolic names; they are macros defined in
@file{errno.h}.  The names start with @samp{E} and an upper-case
letter or digit; you should consider names of this form to be
reserved names.  @xref{Reserved Names}.

The error code values are all positive integers and are all distinct,
with one exception: @code{EWOULDBLOCK} and @code{EAGAIN} are the same.
Since the values are distinct, you can use them as labels in a
@code{switch} statement; just don't use both @code{EWOULDBLOCK} and
@code{EAGAIN}.  Your program should not make any other assumptions about
the specific values of these symbolic constants.

The value of @code{errno} doesn't necessarily have to correspond to any
of these macros, since some library functions might return other error
codes of their own for other situations.  The only values that are
guaranteed to be meaningful for a particular library function are the
ones that this manual lists for that function.

On non-GNU systems, almost any system call can return @code{EFAULT} if
it is given an invalid pointer as an argument.  Since this could only
happen as a result of a bug in your program, and since it will not
happen on the GNU system, we have saved space by not mentioning
@code{EFAULT} in the descriptions of individual functions.

In some Unix systems, many system calls can also return @code{EFAULT} if
given as an argument a pointer into the stack, and the kernel for some
obscure reason fails in its attempt to extend the stack.  If this ever
happens, you should probably try using statically or dynamically
allocated memory instead of stack memory on that system.

@section Error Codes

@pindex errno.h
The error code macros are defined in the header file @file{errno.h}.
All of them expand into integer constant values.  Some of these error
codes can't occur on the GNU system, but they can occur using the GNU
library on other systems.

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Operation not permitted
@deftypevr Macro int EPERM
@comment errno 1 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Operation not permitted; only the owner of the file (or other resource)
or processes with special privileges can perform the operation.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: No such file or directory
@deftypevr Macro int ENOENT
@comment errno 2 @c DO NOT REMOVE

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: No such process
@deftypevr Macro int ESRCH
@comment errno 3 @c DO NOT REMOVE
No process matches the specified process ID.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Interrupted system call
@deftypevr Macro int EINTR
@comment errno 4 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Interrupted function call; an asynchronous signal occurred and prevented
completion of the call.  When this happens, you should try the call
again.

You can choose to have functions resume after a signal that is handled,
rather than failing with @code{EINTR}; see @ref{Interrupted
Primitives}.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Input/output error
@deftypevr Macro int EIO
@comment errno 5 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Input/output error; usually used for physical read or write errors.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Device not configured
@deftypevr Macro int ENXIO
@comment errno 6 @c DO NOT REMOVE
No such device or address.  The system tried to use the device
represented by a file you specified, and it couldn't find the device.
This can mean that the device file was installed incorrectly, or that
the physical device is missing or not correctly attached to the
computer.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Argument list too long
@deftypevr Macro int E2BIG
@comment errno 7 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Argument list too long; used when the arguments passed to a new program
being executed with one of the @code{exec} functions (@pxref{Executing a
File}) occupy too much memory space.  This condition never arises in the
GNU system.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Exec format error
@deftypevr Macro int ENOEXEC
@comment errno 8 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Invalid executable file format.  This condition is detected by the

versa).
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: No child processes
@deftypevr Macro int ECHILD
@comment errno 10 @c DO NOT REMOVE
There are no child processes.  This error happens on operations that are
supposed to manipulate child processes, when there aren't any processes
to manipulate.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Resource deadlock avoided
@deftypevr Macro int EDEADLK
@comment errno 11 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Deadlock avoided; allocating a system resource would have resulted in a
deadlock situation.  The system does not guarantee that it will notice
all such situations.  This error means you got lucky and the system
noticed; it might just hang.  @xref{File Locks}, for an example.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Cannot allocate memory
@deftypevr Macro int ENOMEM
@comment errno 12 @c DO NOT REMOVE
No memory available.  The system cannot allocate more virtual memory
because its capacity is full.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Permission denied
@deftypevr Macro int EACCES
@comment errno 13 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Permission denied; the file permissions do not allow the attempted operation.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Bad address
@deftypevr Macro int EFAULT
@comment errno 14 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Bad address; an invalid pointer was detected.
In the GNU system, this error never happens; you get a signal instead.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment BSD: Block device required
@deftypevr Macro int ENOTBLK
@comment errno 15 @c DO NOT REMOVE
A file that isn't a block special file was given in a situation that
requires one.  For example, trying to mount an ordinary file as a file
system in Unix gives this error.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Device or resource busy
@deftypevr Macro int EBUSY
@comment errno 16 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Resource busy; a system resource that can't be shared is already in use.
For example, if you try to delete a file that is the root of a currently
mounted filesystem, you get this error.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: File exists
@deftypevr Macro int EEXIST
@comment errno 17 @c DO NOT REMOVE
File exists; an existing file was specified in a context where it only
makes sense to specify a new file.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Invalid cross-device link
@deftypevr Macro int EXDEV
@comment errno 18 @c DO NOT REMOVE
An attempt to make an improper link across file systems was detected.
This happens not only when you use @code{link} (@pxref{Hard Links}) but
also when you rename a file with @code{rename} (@pxref{Renaming Files}).
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: No such device
@deftypevr Macro int ENODEV
@comment errno 19 @c DO NOT REMOVE
The wrong type of device was given to a function that expects a
particular sort of device.

@deftypevr Macro int ENOTDIR
@comment errno 20 @c DO NOT REMOVE
A file that isn't a directory was specified when a directory is required.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Is a directory
@deftypevr Macro int EISDIR
@comment errno 21 @c DO NOT REMOVE
File is a directory; you cannot open a directory for writing,
or create or remove hard links to it.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Invalid argument
@deftypevr Macro int EINVAL
@comment errno 22 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Invalid argument.  This is used to indicate various kinds of problems
with passing the wrong argument to a library function.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Too many open files
@deftypevr Macro int EMFILE
@comment errno 24 @c DO NOT REMOVE
The current process has too many files open and can't open any more.
Duplicate descriptors do count toward this limit.

In BSD and GNU, the number of open files is controlled by a resource
limit that can usually be increased.  If you get this error, you might
want to increase the @code{RLIMIT_NOFILE} limit or make it unlimited;
@pxref{Limits on Resources}.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Too many open files in system
@deftypevr Macro int ENFILE
@comment errno 23 @c DO NOT REMOVE
There are too many distinct file openings in the entire system.  Note
that any number of linked channels count as just one file opening; see
@ref{Linked Channels}.  This error never occurs in the GNU system.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Inappropriate ioctl for device
@deftypevr Macro int ENOTTY
@comment errno 25 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Inappropriate I/O control operation, such as trying to set terminal
modes on an ordinary file.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment BSD: Text file busy
@deftypevr Macro int ETXTBSY
@comment errno 26 @c DO NOT REMOVE
An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or
write to a file that is currently being executed.  Often using a
debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and
will cause this error.  (The name stands for ``text file busy''.)  This
is not an error in the GNU system; the text is copied as necessary.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: File too large
@deftypevr Macro int EFBIG
@comment errno 27 @c DO NOT REMOVE
File too big; the size of a file would be larger than allowed by the system.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: No space left on device
@deftypevr Macro int ENOSPC
@comment errno 28 @c DO NOT REMOVE
No space left on device; write operation on a file failed because the
disk is full.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Illegal seek
@deftypevr Macro int ESPIPE
@comment errno 29 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Invalid seek operation (such as on a pipe).
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Read-only file system
@deftypevr Macro int EROFS
@comment errno 30 @c DO NOT REMOVE
An attempt was made to modify something on a read-only file system.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Too many links
@deftypevr Macro int EMLINK
@comment errno 31 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Too many links; the link count of a single file would become too large.
@code{rename} can cause this error if the file being renamed already has
as many links as it can take (@pxref{Renaming Files}).
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Broken pipe
@deftypevr Macro int EPIPE
@comment errno 32 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Broken pipe; there is no process reading from the other end of a pipe.
Every library function that returns this error code also generates a
@code{SIGPIPE} signal; this signal terminates the program if not handled
or blocked.  Thus, your program will never actually see @code{EPIPE}
unless it has handled or blocked @code{SIGPIPE}.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment ISO: Numerical argument out of domain
@deftypevr Macro int EDOM
@comment errno 33 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Domain error; used by mathematical functions when an argument value does
not fall into the domain over which the function is defined.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment ISO: Numerical result out of range
@deftypevr Macro int ERANGE
@comment errno 34 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Range error; used by mathematical functions when the result value is
not representable because of overflow or underflow.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment POSIX.1: Resource temporarily unavailable
@deftypevr Macro int EAGAIN
@comment errno 35 @c DO NOT REMOVE
Resource temporarily unavailable; the call might work if you try again
later.  The macro @code{EWOULDBLOCK} is another name for @code{EAGAIN};
they are always the same in the GNU C library.

This error can happen in a few different situations:

@itemize @bullet
@item
An operation that would block was attempted on an object that has
non-blocking mode selected.  Trying the same operation again will block
until some external condition makes it possible to read, write, or
connect (whatever the operation).  You can use @code{select} to find out
when the operation will be possible; @pxref{Waiting for I/O}.

@strong{Portability Note:} In many older Unix systems, this condition
was indicated by @code{EWOULDBLOCK}, which was a distinct error code
different from @code{EAGAIN}.  To make your program portable, you should
check for both codes and treat them the same.

@item
A temporary resource shortage made an operation impossible.  @code{fork}
can return this error.  It indicates that the shortage is expected to
pass, so your program can try the call again later and it may succeed.
It is probably a good idea to delay for a few seconds before trying it
again, to allow time for other processes to release scarce resources.
Such shortages are usually fairly serious and affect the whole system,
so usually an interactive program should report the error to the user
and return to its command loop.
@end itemize
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment BSD: Operation would block
@deftypevr Macro int EWOULDBLOCK
@comment errno EAGAIN @c DO NOT REMOVE
In the GNU C library, this is another name for @code{EAGAIN} (above).
The values are always the same, on every operating system.

C libraries in many older Unix systems have @code{EWOULDBLOCK} as a
separate error code.
@end deftypevr

@comment errno.h
@comment BSD: Operation now in progress
@deftypevr Macro int EINPROGRESS
@comment errno 36 @c DO NOT REMOVE
An operation that cannot complete immediately was initiated on an object
that has non-blocking mode selected.  Some functions that must always
block (such as @code{connect}; @pxref{Connecting}) never return
@code{EAGAIN}.  Instead, they return @code{EINPROGRESS} to indicate that
the operation has begun and will take some time.  Attempts to manipulate
the object before the call completes return @code{EALREADY}.  You can
use the @code{select} function to find out when the pending operation
has completed; @pxref{Waiting for I/O}.

@comment errno 45 @c DO NOT REMOVE
The operation you requested is not supported.  Some socket functions
don't make sense for all types of sockets, and others may not be
implemented for all communications protocols.  In the GNU system, this

@node Error Messages,  , Error Codes, Error Reporting
@section Error Messages

The library has functions and variables designed to make it easy for
your program to report informative error messages in the customary
format about the failure of a library call.  The functions
@code{strerror} and @code{perror} give you the standard error message
for a given error code; the variable
@w{@code{program_invocation_short_name}} gives you convenient access to the
name of the program that encountered the error.

@comment string.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun {char *} strerror (int @var{errnum})
The @code{strerror} function maps the error code (@pxref{Checking for
Errors}) specified by the @var{errnum} argument to a descriptive error
message string.  The return value is a pointer to this string.

The value @var{errnum} normally comes from the variable @code{errno}.

You should not modify the string returned by @code{strerror}.  Also, if
you make subsequent calls to @code{strerror}, the string might be
overwritten.  (But it's guaranteed that no library function ever calls
@code{strerror} behind your back.)

The function @code{strerror} is declared in @file{string.h}.
@end deftypefun

@comment string.h
@comment GNU
@deftypefun {char *} strerror_r (int @var{errnum}, char *@var{buf}, size_t @var{n})
The @code{strerror_r} function works like @code{strerror} but instead of
returning the error message in a statically allocated buffer shared by
all threads in the process, it returns a private copy for the
thread. This might be either some permanent global data or a message
string in the user supplied buffer starting at @var{buf} with the
length of @var{n} bytes.

At most @var{n} characters are written (including the NUL byte) so it is
up to the user to select the buffer large enough.

This function should always be used in multi-threaded programs since
there is no way to guarantee the string returned by @code{strerror}
really belongs to the last call of the current thread.

This function @code{strerror_r} is a GNU extension and it is declared in
@file{string.h}.
@end deftypefun

@comment stdio.h
@comment ISO
@deftypefun void perror (const char *@var{message})
This function prints an error message to the stream @code{stderr};
see @ref{Standard Streams}.

If you call @code{perror} with a @var{message} that is either a null
pointer or an empty string, @code{perror} just prints the error message
corresponding to @code{errno}, adding a trailing newline.

If you supply a non-null @var{message} argument, then @code{perror}
prefixes its output with this string.  It adds a colon and a space
character to separate the @var{message} from the error string corresponding
to @code{errno}.

The function @code{perror} is declared in @file{stdio.h}.
@end deftypefun

@code{strerror} and @code{perror} produce the exact same message for any
given error code; the precise text varies from system to system.  On the
GNU system, the messages are fairly short; there are no multi-line
messages or embedded newlines.  Each error message begins with a capital
letter and does not include any terminating punctuation.

@strong{Compatibility Note:}  The @code{strerror} function is a new
feature of @w{ISO C}.  Many older C systems do not support this function
yet.

@cindex program name
@cindex name of running program
Many programs that don't read input from the terminal are designed to
exit if any system call fails.  By convention, the error message from
such a program should start with the program's name, sans directories.
You can find that name in the variable
@code{program_invocation_short_name}; the full file name is stored the
variable @code{program_invocation_name}:

@comment errno.h
@comment GNU
@deftypevar {char *} program_invocation_name
This variable's value is the name that was used to invoke the program
running in the current process.  It is the same as @code{argv[0]}.  Note
that this is not necessarily a useful file name; often it contains no
directory names.  @xref{Program Arguments}.
@end deftypevar

@comment errno.h
@comment GNU
@deftypevar {char *} program_invocation_short_name
This variable's value is the name that was used to invoke the program
running in the current process, with directory names removed.  (That is
to say, it is the same as @code{program_invocation_name} minus
everything up to the last slash, if any.)
@end deftypevar

The library initialization code sets up both of these variables before
calling @code{main}.

@strong{Portability Note:} These two variables are GNU extensions.  If
you want your program to work with non-GNU libraries, you must save the
value of @code{argv[0]} in @code{main}, and then strip off the directory
names yourself.  We added these extensions to make it possible to write
self-contained error-reporting subroutines that require no explicit
cooperation from @code{main}.

Here is an example showing how to handle failure to open a file
correctly.  The function @code{open_sesame} tries to open the named file
for reading and returns a stream if successful.  The @code{fopen}
library function returns a null pointer if it couldn't open the file for
some reason.  In that situation, @code{open_sesame} constructs an
appropriate error message using the @code{strerror} function, and
terminates the program.  If we were going to make some other library
calls before passing the error code to @code{strerror}, we'd have to
save it in a local variable instead, because those other library
functions might overwrite @code{errno} in the meantime.

               program_invocation_short_name, name, strerror (errno));
      exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
    @}

    return stream;
