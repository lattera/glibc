@item
The timezone support code is derived from the public-domain timezone
package by Arthur David Olson and his many contributors.

@item
Some of the support code for Mach is taken from Mach 3.0 by CMU;
the file @file{if_ppp.h} is also copyright by CMU, but under a different license;

@item
The random number generation functions @code{random}, @code{srandom},
@code{setstate} and @code{initstate}, which are also the basis for the
@code{rand} and @code{srand} functions, were written by Earl T. Cohen
for the University of California at Berkeley and are copyrighted by the
Regents of the University of California.  They have undergone minor
changes to fit into @theglibc{} and to fit the @w{ISO C} standard,
but the functional code is Berkeley's.@refill

@item
The Internet-related code (most of the @file{inet} subdirectory) and
several other miscellaneous functions and header files have been
included from 4.4 BSD with little or no modification.  The copying
permission notice for this code can be found in the file @file{LICENSES}
in the source distribution.

code were written by Craig Metz; see the file @file{LICENSES} for
details on their licensing.

@item
The DNS resolver code is taken directly from BIND 4.9.5, which
includes copyrighted code from UC Berkeley and from Digital Equipment
Corporation.  See the file @file{LICENSES} for the text of the DEC license.

@item
The code to support Sun RPC is taken verbatim from Sun's

Microsystems, as modified by J.T. Conklin, Ian Lance Taylor,
Ulrich Drepper, Andreas Schwab, and Roland McGrath.

@item
Many of the IEEE 64-bit double precision math functions
(in the @file{sysdeps/ieee754/dbl-64} subdirectory) come
from the IBM Accurate Mathematical Library, contributed by IBM.

@item
Many of the IA64 math functions are taken from a collection of
``Highly Optimized Mathematical Functions for Itanium'' that Intel
makes available under a free license; see the file @file{LICENSES} for
details.
