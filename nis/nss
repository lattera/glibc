# /etc/default/nss
# This file can theoretically contain a bunch of customization variables
# for Name Service Switch in the GNU C library.  For now there are only two
# variables:
#
# NETID_AUTHORITATIVE
#   If set to TRUE, the initgroups() function will accept the information
#   from the netid.byname NIS map as authoritative.  This can speed up the
#   function significantly if the group.byname map is large.  The content
#   of the netid.byname map is used AS IS.  The system administrator has
#   to make sure it is correctly generated.
#NETID_AUTHORITATIVE=TRUE
#
# SERVICES_AUTHORITATIVE
#   If set to TRUE, the getservbyname{,_r}() function will assume
#   services.byservicename NIS map exists and is authoritative, particularly
#   that it contains both keys with /proto and without /proto for both
#   primary service names and service aliases.  The system administrator
#   has to make sure it is correctly generated.
#SERVICES_AUTHORITATIVE=TRUE
